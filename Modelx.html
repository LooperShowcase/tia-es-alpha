    <h2>
      The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla
      Model S. The Model X has an EPA size class as an SUV, and shares ~30% of
      its content with the Model S, half of the originally planned ~60%, and
      weighs about 10 percent more. Both the Model X and Model S are being
      produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. The prototype was
      unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne, California on February 9,
      2012. First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015. After one
      full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh among the
      world's best-selling plug-in cars. As of April 12, 2021, the Model X is
      only available as the Long Range with an estimated EPA range of 360.4
      miles (580.0 km) and the Plaid model with an estimated EPA range of 339.9
      miles (547.0 km). Both come with Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance
      system
