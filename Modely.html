      The Tesla Model Y is an electric compact crossover utility vehicle (CUV)
      by Tesla, Inc. Tesla unveiled it in March 2019, started production at its
      Fremont plant in January 2020, and started deliveries on March 13, 2020.
      It is the second vehicle based on the Model 3 sedan platform. The Model Y
      shares an estimated 75% of its parts with the Tesla Model 3, which
      includes a similar interior design and electric powertrain. Model Y offers
      optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity. The Model
      Y fills a smaller and less expensive segment than the full-sized Tesla
      Model X. There were four planned powertrain configurations for the Model
      Y: Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD), Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive,
      Long Range with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD), and Performance (with
      Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive). The Long Range AWD model and the Performance
      model are currently being delivered.[13] The Standard Range RWD
      configuration was initially canceled in July 2020, due to the range (230
      miles EPA) being unacceptably low to Musk, but was orderable as of January
      2021 (with 244 miles of EPA range). By February 7, 2021, the Long Range
      RWD appears to have been cancelled
