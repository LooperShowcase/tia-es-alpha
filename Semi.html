      The Tesla Semi is an all-electric battery-powered Class 8 semi-truck in
      development by Tesla, Inc. Two concept vehicles were unveiled in November
      2017, and production in 2023 is planned. The company initially announced
      that the truck would have a 500 miles (805 km) range on a full charge and
      with its new batteries it would be able to run for 400 miles (640 km)
      after an 80% charge in 30 minutes using a solar-powered "Tesla
      Megacharger" charging station. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the Semi
      would come standard with Tesla Autopilot that allows semi-autonomous
      driving on highways
