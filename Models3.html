      The Model 3 is an electric fastback mid-size four-door sedan developed by
      Tesla. The Model 3 Standard Range Plus version delivers an EPA-rated
      all-electric range of 262 miles (422 km) and the Long Range version
      delivers 353 miles (568 km). According to Tesla, the Model 3 carries full
      self-driving hardware, with periodic software updates adding
      functionality. Limited production of the Model 3 began in mid-2017, with
      the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly line on July 7,
      2017. The official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars took place on
      July 28. In October 2021, Hertz car rental ordered 100,000 full-price
      Model 3 cars for its rental fleet. The Model 3 was marketed as being more
      affordable to more people than previous models by Tesla. Since early 2020,
      the Model 3 is the best-selling electric car in world history, and, in
      June 2021, became the first electric car to pass the 1 million global
      sales milestone. The Model 3 has been the world's top selling plug-in
      electric car (PEV) for three years running, from 2018 to 2020. It has also
      been the best-selling PEV in the United States for three consecutive
      years, 2018 to 2020, the top selling PEV in Europe in 2019, and the
