      The Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback produced by Tesla,
      Inc. It was introduced on June 22, 2012. It received a major refresh in
      June 2021. Tesla positions the Model S as its flagship. In 2013, the Model
      S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking
      in any country, leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013
      and in Denmark in December 2015. Sales passed 250,000 units in September
      2018. The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in
      2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model 3. In an early
      review of the Model S, Consumer Reports declared, "This car performs
      better than anything we've ever tested before. Let me repeat that: Not
      just the best electric car, but the best car. It does just about
      everything really, really well."In their Owner Satisfaction survey owners
      have consistently rated Teslas at, or near, the top rankings. In 2019,
      Motor Trend named the 2013 Tesla Model S the ultimate "Car of the Year"
      over the magazine's entire 70-year history
